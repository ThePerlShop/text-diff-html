Text/Diff/HTML version 0.08
===========================

This class subclasses
[Text::Diff::Unified](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::Diff::Unified), a
formatting class provided by the
[Text-Diff](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Diff) distribution, to add XHTML
markup to the unified diff format.

In the XHTML formatted by this module, the contents of the diff are wrapped in
a `<div>` element, as is each hunk of the diff. Within each hunk, all content
is properly HTML encoded and the various sections of the diff are marked up
with the appropriate XHTML elements.
