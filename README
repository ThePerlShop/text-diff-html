Description
    This class subclasses Text::Diff::Unified, a formatting class provided
    by the Text::Diff module, to add XHTML markup to the unified diff
    format. For details on the interface of the "diff()" function, see the
    Text::Diff documentation.

    In the XHTML formatted by this module, the contents of the diff returned
    by "diff()" are wrapped in a "<div>" element, as is each hunk of the
    diff. Within each hunk, all content is properly HTML encoded using
    HTML::Entities, and the various sections of the diff are marked up with
    "<span>" elements. Each "<div>" and "<span>" element has a class,
    defined as follows:

    * "<div class="file">"
        This element contains the entire contents of the diff "file"
        returned by "diff()". All of the following elements are subsumed by
        this one.

        * "<span class="fileheader">"
            The header section for the files being "diff"ed, usually
            something like:

              --- in.txt    Thu Sep  1 12:51:03 2005
              +++ out.txt   Thu Sep  1 12:52:12 2005

            This element immediately follows the opening "file" "<div>"
            element.

        * "<div class="hunk">"
            This element contains a single diff "hunk". Each hunk may
            contain the following "<span>" elements:

            * "<span class="hunkheader">"
                Header for a diff hunk. The hunk header is usually something
                like:

                  @@ -1,5 +1,7 @@

                This element immediately follows the opening "hunk" "<div>"
                element.

            * "<span class="ctx">"
                Context around the important part of a "diff" hunk. These
                are contents that have *not* changed between the files being
                "diff"ed.

            * "<span class="ins">"
                An insertion line, starting with "+".

            * "<span class="del">"
                A deletion line, starting with "-".

            * "<span class="hunkfooter">"
                The footer section of a hunk; contains no contents.

        * "<span class="filefooter">"
            The footer section of a file; contains no contents.

    You may do whatever you like with these classes; I highly recommend that
    you style them using CSS. You'll find an example CSS file in the eg
    directory in the Text-Diff-HTML distribution. You will also likely want
    to wrap the output of your diff a "<pre>" element.
