Synopsis
        use Text::Diff;

        my $diff = diff "file1.txt", "file2.txt", { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
        my $diff = diff \$string1,   \$string2,   { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
        my $diff = diff \*FH1,       \*FH2,       { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
        my $diff = diff \&reader1,   \&reader2,   { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
        my $diff = diff \@records1,  \@records2,  { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };

Description
    This class subclasses Text::Diff::Unified, a formatting class provided
    by the Text::Diff module, to add HTML markup to the unified diff format.
    Each line of the diff has its characters properly encoded for HTML, and
    is appropriately marked up with a "<span>" tag. Each span tag has a
    class, defined as follows:

    fileheader
        The header section for the files being "diff"ed, usually something
        like:

          --- in.txt    Thu Sep  1 12:51:03 2005
          +++ out.txt   Thu Sep  1 12:52:12 2005

    hunkheader
        Header for a diff hunk. The hunk header is usually something like:

          @@ -1,5 +1,7 @@

    cx  Context around the important part of a "diff" hunk. These are
        contents that have *not* changed between the files being "diff"ed.

    ins An insertion line, starting with "+".

    del An deletion line, starting with "-".

    hunkfooter
        The footer section of a hunk; contains no contents.

    filefooter
        The footer section of a file; contains no contents.

    You may do whatever you like with these classes; I highly recommend that
    you style them using CSS. You'll find an example CSS file in the "eg"
    directory in the Text-Diff-HTML distribution. You will also likely want
    to wrap the output of your diff in "<pre>" tags.
