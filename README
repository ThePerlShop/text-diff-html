Description
    This class subclasses Text::Diff::Unified, a formatting class provided
    by the Text::Diff module, to add XHTML markup to the unified diff
    format. For details on the interface of the "diff()" function, see the
    Text::Diff documentation.

    In the XHTML formatted by this module, the contents of the diff returned
    by "diff()" are wrapped in a "<div>" element, as is each hunk of the
    diff. Within each hunk, all content is properly HTML encoded using
    HTML::Entities, and the various sections of the diff are marked up with
    the appropriate XHTML elements. The elements used are as follows:

    *   "<div class="file">"

        This element contains the entire contents of the diff "file"
        returned by "diff()". All of the following elements are subsumed by
        this one.

        *   "<span class="fileheader">"

            The header section for the files being "diff"ed, usually
            something like:

              --- in.txt    Thu Sep  1 12:51:03 2005
              +++ out.txt   Thu Sep  1 12:52:12 2005

            This element immediately follows the opening "file" "<div>"
            element.

        *   "<div class="hunk">"

            This element contains a single diff "hunk". Each hunk may
            contain the following elements:

            *   "<span class="hunkheader">"

                Header for a diff hunk. The hunk header is usually something
                like:

                  @@ -1,5 +1,7 @@

                This element immediately follows the opening "hunk" "<div>"
                element.

            *   "<span class="ctx">"

                Context around the important part of a "diff" hunk. These
                are contents that have *not* changed between the files being
                "diff"ed.

            *   "<ins>"

                Inserted content, each line starting with "+".

            *   "<del>"

                Deleted content, each line starting with "-".

            *   "<span class="hunkfooter">"

                The footer section of a hunk; contains no contents.

        *   "<span class="filefooter">"

            The footer section of a file; contains no contents.

    You may do whatever you like with these elements and classes; I highly
    recommend that you style them using CSS. You'll find an example CSS file
    in the eg directory in the Text-Diff-HTML distribution. You will also
    likely want to wrap the output of your diff a "<pre>" element.
