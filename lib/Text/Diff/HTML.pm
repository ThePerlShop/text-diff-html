# Each of the items in $seqs is an array reference. The first one has the
# contents of the first file and the second has the contents of the second
# file, all broken into hunks. $ops is an array reference of array references,
# one corresponding to each of the hunks in the sequences.
#
# The contents of each op in $ops tell us what to do with each hunk. Each op
# can have up to four items:
#
# 0: The index of the relevant hunk in the first file sequence.
# 1: The index of the relevant hunk in the second file sequence.
# 2: The opcode for the hunk, either '+', '-', or ' '.
# 3: A flag; not sure what this is, doesn't seem to apply to unified diffs.
#
# So what we do is figure out which op we have and output the relevant span
# tag if it is different from the last op. Then we select the hunk from second
# sequence (SEQ_B_IDX) if it's '+' and the first sequence (SEQ_A_IDX)
# otherwise, and then output the opcode and the hunk.

=head1 Name

Text::Diff::HTML - HTML format for Text::Diff::Unified

=head1 Synopsis

    use Text::Diff;

    my $diff = diff "file1.txt", "file2.txt", { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
    my $diff = diff \$string1,   \$string2,   { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
    my $diff = diff \*FH1,       \*FH2,       { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
    my $diff = diff \&reader1,   \&reader2,   { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
    my $diff = diff \@records1,  \@records2,  { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };
    my $diff = diff \@records1,  "file.txt",  { STYLE => 'Text::Diff::HTML' };

=head1 Description

This class subclasses Text::Diff::Unified, a formatting class provided by the
L<Text::Diff|Text::Diff> module, to add HTML markup to the unified diff
format. Each line of the diff has its characters properly encoded for HTML,
and is appropriately marked up with a C<< <span> >> tag. Each span tag has a
class, defined as follows:

=over

=item fileheader

The header section for the files being C<diff>ed, usually something like:

  --- in.txt	Thu Sep  1 12:51:03 2005
  +++ out.txt	Thu Sep  1 12:52:12 2005

=item hunkheader

Header for a diff hunk. The hunk header is usually something like:

  @@ -1,5 +1,7 @@

=item cx

Context around the important part of a C<diff> hunk. These are contents that
have I<not> changed between the files being C<diff>ed.

=item ins

An insertion line, starting with C<+>.

=item del

An deletion line, starting with C<->.

=item hunkfooter

The footer section of a hunk; contains no contents.

=item filefooter

The footer section of a file; contains no contents.

=back

You may do whatever you like with these classes; I highly recommend that you
style them using CSS. You'll find an example CSS file in the C<eg> directory
in the Text-Diff-HTML distribution. You will also likely want to wrap the
output of your diff in C<< <pre> >> tags.
