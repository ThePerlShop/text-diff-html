      - Swiched from <span class="ins"> and <span class="del"> to <ins>
        and <del> elements. Why didn't I notice those before? Sorry for yet
        another change in the XHTML, but this is more semantic, and I there-
        fore don't expect to change it again. Suggested by Lucas Carlson.
      - Rejiggered sample CSS in "eg/diff.css" for new XHTML elements and
        shorter background color specs.

0.03  2005-09-05T18:40:29
      - Improved CSS examples in "eg/diff.css" by using more specific
        selectors.
      - Minor code and documentation reformatting.

        Marshall Roch.
      - Fixed a number of annoying documentation typos and improved the
        documentation of each XHTML element.
